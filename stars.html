            <div class="article-content">
                <p>
                    On Sept. 1, 1859, the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history paid Earth a visit. 
                    This colossal solar outburst, which led to telegraph systems catching fire and aurorae lighting up skies down to the tropics,
                    became known as the Carrington Event, in honor of English amateur astronomer Richard Carrington, who determined that a major coronal mass ejection (CME) was to blame for these curious happenings. 
                </p>
                <h1>The impact of CMEs</h1>
                <p>
                    Though powerful, solar storms pose little threat to humans or other living creatures, even when CMEs blast material straight at our planet. 
                    Rather, they are far more likely to impact electrical components and systems. This is because they generate induced currents that can flow into the electrical grid, wreaking havoc. 
                    In 1859, the world was not especially reliant on electricity, meaning that despite the spectacle, the Carrington Event was only moderately disruptive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Were a similar incident to occur today, however, the effects would be calamitous. And, with the risk of geomagnetic
                    storms increasing as we approach the next solar maximum — the period of highest activity in the Sun’s 11-year cycle,
                    expected to peak next in 2025 — the need for robust prediction and mitigation strategies is a pressing concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The key impacts [of a major CME] would primarily be satellites, both radiation exposure and risk of unplanned
                    deorbiting or positional changes; radiation exposure to aircraft over the poles; radio communication blackouts; and
                    damage to electrical power grids and railways,” explains Andy Smith, Senior Research Fellow at Northumbria
                    University in the United Kingdom. “The worst-case scenario would likely involve … damage to electrical infrastructure, leading to long-lasting blackouts around the world,” he adds.
                </p>
                <p>Even short power outages can be deadly if people lose access to medical devices and climate control. Maybe you’ve experienced tossing a freezer full of spoiled food. Now imagine there are no working freezers at all — for months. And no access to bank accounts or advanced medical care. It would be catastrophic. </p>
                <p>Fortunately, a number of leading scientists, researchers, and institutions are aware of this danger and are working on ways to predict when a CME is liable to occur and how the consequences could be dampened in the wake of a particularly severe one.</p>
                <h1>The answer is AI</h1>
                <p>The best approach, many experts have suggested, could be to effectively harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI). “In principle, AI can help to accurately forecast either the conditions that can lead to problems, or the problems themselves,” says Smith.</p>
                <p>NASA is one of the pioneers of such AI technology. Working alongside the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA has used deep learning to build DAGGER, an AI-driven computer model that can predict geomagnetic disturbances caused by solar storms 30 minutes before they occur. </p>
                <p>By analyzing solar wind data from various NASA satellites, DAGGER can produce rapid, global predictions that are updated by the minute. This could help power grid operators, satellite controllers, and telecom companies prepare for — and ultimately mitigate — the effects of solar storms on critical infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Other organizations are also exploring AI’s usefulness in this area. The Europlanet 2024 Research Infrastructure (RI) is a major project that supports planetary science in Europe by providing open access to a wealth of data from various space missions, simulations, and laboratory experiments. Utilizing this information, the Know Center and the Space Research Institute, both based in Graz, Austria, have joined forces to see whether machine learning can predict solar storm risk. </p>
                <p>While the development of its model is still in the early stages, initial observations published in the journal Space Weather found that such a model “might be suited for operational space weather forecasting in the future.”</p>
                <p>“The advantage of AI is that the models run much more quickly than physics-based models, so [they] have the potential to provide more lead time,” explains Amy Keesee, Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Hampshire. “One of the challenges for usable forecasts, particularly for effects like geomagnetically induced currents, is their localized nature. Having such high spatial resolution in a physics-based simulation is computationally expensive, and therefore takes longer to run.”</p>
                <p>And when the fastest computer programs can only give 30 minutes lead time, there’s no time to waste.</p>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p>When we think of color in the night sky, we often think of beautiful images of galaxies and nebulae. Unfortunately, most of the time, their faint, diffuse light shows no color to our human eyes. Stars, on the other hand, have more concentrated light, and there we can see color — even with the naked eye!</p>
                    <p>So why do stars appear to have color, and in a variety of hues at that? The short answer is that the temperature of a hot object determines the shape and position of the emitted spectrum. In general, cooler objects peak at redder wavelengths, and hotter objects peak at bluer wavelengths. Think of the flame on a propane stove, which is blue toward
                    the hotter bottom and orange toward the cooler top. The Sun, with a surface temperature of 5,700 kelvins (9,800 degrees Fahrenheit [5,400 degrees Celsius]), peaks in the green portion of the visible spectrum but appears white because the intensity of the red and blue light is nearly as high as the green. Red supergiant Betelgeuse, with a surface temperature of 3,700 kelvins (6,200 F [3,400 C]), peaks in the red and appears orange to our eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For stars, there is a relationship between the color, temperature, size, and chemical composition. You may have heard the Sun called a type G2V star, or that the members of the Pleiades (M45) are hot B-type stars. These are both examples of spectral types. There are six traditional designations for stars: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M.
                </p>
                <p>Type O stars, which are the hottest and bluest, are also extremely luminous; some of the most massive stars are O-type. At the other extreme, M-type stars are by far the most common — they account for 76 percent of the main-sequence stars in our neighborhood. Most M-type stars are red dwarfs, but there are a few notable exceptions. One is the extreme star VY Canis Majoris, a red hypergiant that is the one of the largest and most luminous stars known in the entire Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

                <figcaption>Stars, like incandescent bulbs, produce different spectra depending on their temperature. The color we perceive an object to be depends on the balance of light across the part of the spectrum to which our eyes are sensitive.

                <p>Each spectral type is split into 10 subdivisions, which are denoted by adding a numeral. Within each letter class, 0 is hottest and 9 is coolest.</p>
                <p>A Roman numeral can also be added to indicate the luminosity class of the star, with I for supergiants, II for bright giants, III for regular giants, IV for subgiants, V for main-sequence stars, VI (or sd) for subdwarfs, and VII (or D) for white dwarfs. This distinguishes a red giant from a red dwarf with the same effective temperature.</p>
                <p>You can see star colors in action by checking out the double star Albireo (Beta [β] Cygni), located at the head of Cygnus the Swan. A small telescope or mounted 10×50 binoculars can resolve the pair, with one glowing orange (Beta Cygni A) and one blazing blue (Beta Cygni B). The A star is itself a double star, although not resolvable by amateur instruments. Beta Cygni Aa is a K-type star, with a surface temperature of 4,400 K and a mass of 5.2 solar masses. Beta Cygni B is a B-type star of temperature 13,200 K and is 3.7 solar masses. You can catch Albireo just about all night this month.</p>
                <p>Another beautiful color-contrasting pair is the double star Eta (η) Cassiopeiae, located between Navi and Shedar, the two bottom points of the Cassiopeia W. You will need a telescope for this one, but a refractor will do — 64x is enough for a nice view. Eta Cas is slightly more challenging with its four-magnitude difference in brightness between the two stars. Some people see the pair as yellow and red, while some see gold and purple. The brighter of the two is a G0V main-sequence star, very similar to our Sun. Its partner is a K7V main-sequence star. This binary — which lies only 19.4 light-years away — is also visible all night this month.</p>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Turbulence abounds in nature, from the spinning whorls of hurricanes to the brilliant swirls of Jupiter’s immense storms. Astronomers have even observed it where stars are born in the vast maelstrom of molecular clouds. But much as scientists have tried, no single theory has ever captured the full scale and unpredictability of turbulence. Nobel laureate Richard Feynman once called it “the most important unsolved problem of classical physics.”</p>
                <p>Yet, a study released today in Physics of Fluids shows that the artist Vincent van Gogh captured theories of fluid dynamics in “The Starry Night,” depicting complex patterns of turbulence at large and small scales. Scientists say that the revered oil-on-canvas work, painted in June 1889, captures details that adhere with amazing fidelity to the physical laws of turbulence — laws that would not be formulated until 52 years later.</p>
                <p>Turbulence in the atmosphere causes the phenomenon that astronomers call seeing; as light passes through eddies in the air, it is refracted, causing images to blur and stars to pulsate in brightness. In other words, whether through uncanny intuition or meticulous observation, van Gogh’s dynamic rendering of whorls and starlight captured the very physics that cause air to swirl and stars to twinkle.</p>
                <p>Ironically, van Gogh considered “The Starry Night” a failure. To save on postage, he skipped sending it with other paintings to his brother Theo, an art dealer, for public sale. Today it is one of the most recognizable and acclaimed paintings in Western art.</p>
                <p>It has also become a matter of considerable scientific interest. For the past 16 years, fluid dynamicists have debated in research papers whether “The Starry Night” truly reflects the mathematical structure of turbulence, or, like many other works — including Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” — merely imitates it.</p>
                <p>“Our findings settle the ongoing debate about whether the dynamic sky in this renowned painting is reflective of true physical phenomena,” says study co-author Yongxiang Huang of Xiamen University in China.</p>
                <h1>Art’s starring role</h1>
                <p>Created a year before van Gogh’s death as the artist sat in an insane asylum in France, “The Starry Night” pictures outsized twinkling stars and a crescent Moon amid a swirling chaos of azure sky. Like many impressionistic paintings of the time, it uses “broken color” — the technique of placing distinct colors next to each that appear similarly bright, creating a dramatic, pulsating effect of flow and movement.</p>
                <p>At the time, scientific understanding of turbulence was lagging. It wasn’t until half a century later that Russian physicist Andrey Kolmogorov penned the first equations to describe turbulence.</p>
                <p>Kolmogorov described how energy cascades from large eddies down to smaller eddies, a phenomenon that can be observed in nature. For instance, in low-resolution images, Jupiter’s Great Red Spot appears to be a single large whorl. But zoom in, and you’ll find ever smaller eddies, feeding off of the energy of the larger ones.</p>

                <p>Huang and his colleagues analyzed all 14 major swirls in “The Starry Night.” Unlike previous teams that also searched for turbulence in “The Starry Night,” they focused on just the swirls, masking out the rest of the sky. They then measured the variations in brightness across each of them to see if they matched those predicted by theory.</p>
                <p>Remarkably, van Gogh passes with flying colors. Kolmogorov’s equation predicts that energy falls across different sizes of eddies in the form of an inverse power law with an exponent of –5/3, or –1.67 in rounded decimal form. The new work finds that the eddies in “The Starry Night” obey this law with remarkable precision, with an exponent of –1.67 or –1.68 (depending on whether you’re measuring across or up and down) — with associated uncertainties of 0.13 and 0.19.</p>
                <p>In “The Starry Night” and its dynamic sky, “the arrangement of the eddy-like formations crafted by van Gogh resembles the energy transfer mechanism in real turbulent flows,” the authors write.</p>
